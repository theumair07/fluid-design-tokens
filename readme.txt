= What are fluid design tokens? =

Fluid design tokens are CSS custom properties that automatically scale between different viewport sizes, providing a smooth transition from mobile to desktop views.

The plugin automatically detects your viewport settings from Elementor if it's installed, or uses default responsive breakpoints (320px to 1200px).
